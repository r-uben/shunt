# M9 — Opt-in admin web surface

M9 adds an opt-in, admin-authenticated web surface to shunt so an operator can
provision upstream Claude and Codex/ChatGPT accounts from a browser and observe
account-pool health without shell access. It builds directly on M8
([`m8-anthropic-multi-account.md`](m8-anthropic-multi-account.md)): the store, the
per-request account resolution, and the `AccountPool` quota/cooldown state all
already exist — M9 only adds an HTTP surface over them.

The surface is deliberately co-designed to share its foundations (session auth,
server-rendered page + CSRF convention, a single-use pending-login store, one
`[server.admin]` opt-in) with the planned Claude-apps gateway-login milestone,
which is *inbound* (client → shunt authorization server) where this feature is
*outbound* (operator provisions shunt → Anthropic upstream accounts). M9 lands
first and stands alone; gateway login builds on the same session/page layer
rather than growing a second stack.

## Motivation

After M8, adding an account to a deployed shunt required SSH (or
`docker exec`) plus an interactive `shunt login claude --name <n>` flow.
Depending on `--mode`, that flow creates a refreshable full-OAuth login,
imports an existing Claude Code login, or creates a one-year setup token. The
router exposed only `/`, `/health`, `/protocol`, `/v1/models`, `/routes`, and
the two `/v1/messages*` endpoints. Pool health (per-account quota utilization,
cooldowns) was observable only through the `x-shunt-account` response header
and logs. M9 relocates directly provisionable OAuth/setup-token flows from a
TTY to a browser form and surfaces the pool state that already lives in memory.

## Scope

- **Claude and Codex provisioning.** The Claude browser form offers a refreshable
  full-scope OAuth flow and the inference-only, one-year PKCE setup token. The
  Codex form always uses ChatGPT OAuth and stores a refreshable credential.
  Claude uses its fixed hosted manual redirect. ChatGPT redirects to
  `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`; that localhost page is expected to fail
  in the operator's browser, which copies the full address-bar URL (or its
  `<code>#<state>` values) back to shunt. Importing an existing Claude Code or
  Codex credential file stays CLI-only because the source file lives on the host.
- **Usage observation and credential ownership are separate.** The primary
  **Accounts and usage** view automatically discovers supported provider logins on
  the host: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Kimi Code, Grok CLI, and
  Cursor.app. It reads current access/session material only in memory and never
  refreshes, copies, or writes the source; Cursor.app's SQLite state is opened
  read-only. An expired source is reported as unavailable. Claude usage is
  cached for 60 seconds; Codex remains response-derived; the other integrations
  call their first-party read-only quota surfaces.
- **Refresh rotation ownership.** A managed full-OAuth account is refreshed and written
  back by `ClaudeAuthStore`. Because the provider can rotate the refresh token,
  its store file must have one active process owner; copying or sharing it
  across running hosts can invalidate another process. Setup-token accounts
  remain static and avoid this hazard.
- **Full CRUD.** Add (provision), list (metadata only), remove (delete the store
  file), and replace (re-run the flow with the same name, which the store already
  supports).
- **Read-only pool dashboard.** A JSON endpoint plus a table, over the state
  `AccountPool` already tracks. No new state collection.

## Configuration

A new `[server.admin]` block under `[server]`. **Absent ⇒ no admin routes are
registered at all** — the default HTTP surface is unchanged. Present ⇒ the routes
exist and authenticate every request.

```toml
[server.admin]
# header carrying the admin token for API/curl calls
header = "x-shunt-admin-token"
# env var holding admin credentials as name:token pairs (SEPARATE from
# [server.auth] client tokens)
tokens_env = "SHUNT_ADMIN_TOKENS"
session_ttl_secs = 3600   # browser session lifetime after login
pending_ttl_secs = 600    # time to open the authorize URL and paste the code back
```

```bash
export SHUNT_ADMIN_TOKENS="ops:3f9c…"   # comma-separated name:token pairs
```

Admin credentials reuse the inbound-auth token format
([`m4-inbound-auth.md`](m4-inbound-auth.md)) and its constant-time compare, but
are a **separate credential** from `[server.auth]`: client tokens are handed to
devices; admin tokens add upstream accounts. Configuration validation is
**fail-closed** — a present `[server.admin]` whose token source is unset, empty, or
malformed is a startup error, never a silently-open admin surface (identical
discipline to `[server.auth]`).

The token source can be a **file** instead of the environment: `tokens_file` (a
path, `~` expanded) holds the same `name:token` pairs, one per line or
comma-separated. When `tokens_env` is non-empty it wins; otherwise the file is
read, and an unreadable configured file is a startup error. This exists so the
token does not have to live in the launch environment. `shunt dashboard setup`
automates the whole enablement: it writes a random `admin:<token>` to
`~/.shunt/admin-token` (owner-only, `0600`, via the same atomic-write path as
credential writeback), records it as `[server.admin].tokens_file`, adds
`[server.oauth_usage]`, and prints the dashboard URL. It is idempotent —
re-running reuses the token and appends no duplicate block — and leaves any
pre-existing `[server.admin]` untouched.

### Optional OIDC browser login

`[server.admin.oidc]` adds an allowlisted OIDC/SSO button to the token login page.
Admin tokens remain mandatory as the API/curl credential and fallback browser
login; OIDC is an additional browser path, not a replacement security boundary.

```toml
[server.admin.oidc]
public_url = "https://admin.example.com"
issuer = "https://accounts.example.com"
client_id = "shunt-admin"
client_secret_env = "SHUNT_ADMIN_OIDC_SECRET"
allowed_domains = ["example.com"]
# allowed_emails = ["operator@example.net"]
# scopes = ["openid", "email", "profile"]
```

The registered redirect URI is
`{public_url}/admin/oidc/callback`. `public_url` must be a bare HTTPS origin
(loopback HTTP is allowed for local development). The issuer and optional endpoint
overrides use HTTPS or loopback HTTP only. Startup also fails closed for an empty
issuer/client id, missing or empty client-secret environment variable, or an empty
email/domain allowlist.

`POST /admin/oidc/start` is same-origin guarded and rate-limited, discovers or uses
the configured authorization endpoint, creates PKCE plus a short-lived single-use
state, and redirects to the provider. The callback consumes that state before any
exchange, obtains a verified-email identity through the provider's token and
UserInfo endpoints, and re-checks the **current hot-reloaded allowlist** before
minting the ordinary admin session cookie. Provider input and exchange failures
produce generic browser pages; secrets, codes, and tokens are never logged or
echoed. Success always redirects to the fixed `/admin` target.

## Runtime wiring

The split mirrors how M4/M8 already separate hot-reloadable config from
process-lifetime state:

- `RuntimeState.admin_auth: Option<Arc<AdminAuth>>` — re-resolved on every reload,
  so admin token/header edits hot-apply just like `[server.auth]`.
- `AppState.admin_stores: Arc<AdminStores>` — the session, pending-login, and
  rate-limiter stores, created once in `build_router` (like `Arc<AccountPool>`)
  and threaded through the per-request snapshot so a reload never drops a live
  browser session.
- Whether the `/admin*` route tree is registered is decided **once at boot** from
  the initial config (a reload cannot add or drop routes, like `server.bind`). A
  reload that toggles the block on or off logs a `warn!` that it needs a restart;
  disabling it on an already-registered surface makes every admin route reject
  requests (`admin_auth` becomes `None`).

## Authentication and hardening

- **Two credentials, never mixed.** Admin auth is the `[server.admin]` credential;
  it is never the `[server.auth]` client tokens.
- **Browser:** sign in at `/admin/login` with an admin token → an opaque session
  id in an in-memory `SessionStore`, set as cookie `shunt_admin_session`
  (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, `Path=/admin`). The cookie is marked `Secure`
  **unless the request host is loopback**, so local HTTP dev and tests work while
  any real deployment host gets a Secure cookie (reusing M8's `host_is_loopback`
  loopback carve-out).
- **API/curl:** send the admin token in the configured header
  (`x-shunt-admin-token`). Header-token callers carry no ambient cookie and are
  therefore **CSRF-exempt**.
- **CSRF** on every cookie-authenticated JSON mutation: a per-session synchronizer
  token, presented as `x-csrf-token`, plus a same-origin check (`Sec-Fetch-Site`,
  falling back to comparing `Origin`'s authority to `Host`). No CORS. `POST
  /admin/logout` is a plain navigation form that cannot send the header, so it is
  guarded by the same-origin check plus the `SameSite=Strict` cookie instead of
  the synchronizer token.
- **Pending-login store** is in-memory only, single-use, and TTL-bound; each
  completion attempt is counted and the entry is discarded after a small cap. The
  256-bit OAuth `state` already makes guessing infeasible.
- **Rate-limit** on the completion and login endpoints (a coarse global fixed
  window each) against code- and admin-token-guessing storms.
- **Secrets never leak:** the verifier, authorization code, access token, and
  refresh token are never logged and never returned to the browser. The OAuth
  `state` is intentionally carried in the authorize URL and the opaque session
  id only in the `HttpOnly` session cookie — both are protocol values the
  browser must receive, not bearer secrets. Account add/remove is audit-logged
  by name and provisioning mode only.
- Docs recommend binding the admin surface behind HTTPS / a tunnel, same as the
  shared-gateway guide.
- **Emergency token rotation:** browser sessions are validated only against the
  in-memory session store, and the running process's environment is fixed — a
  config reload re-reads `SHUNT_ADMIN_TOKENS` from the *same* startup environment,
  so it neither rotates the token nor drops issued sessions (those persist until
  `session_ttl_secs`, default 1h). If an admin token is compromised, replace it in
  the environment source (systemd unit, `.env`, …) and **restart the process**: the
  restart both loads the new token set and drops every session the old token
  minted. To disable the last admin credential, remove the `[server.admin]` block
  before restarting (an empty `SHUNT_ADMIN_TOKENS` fails closed at startup).
  Rejecting stale sessions on reload is tracked in #100.

## Endpoints (registered only when `[server.admin]` is set)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `GET` | `/admin` | Dashboard (HTML); redirects to `/admin/login` when not signed in |
| `GET`,`POST` | `/admin/login` | Token or OIDC login form → session cookie |
| `POST` | `/admin/oidc/start` | Start the optional same-origin OIDC/PKCE browser login |
| `GET` | `/admin/oidc/callback` | Complete OIDC login, enforce the current allowlist, and mint a session |
| `POST` | `/admin/logout` | Clear the session |
| `GET` | `/admin/accounts` | JSON: Claude store metadata (name, kind, expiry, UUID — never the token) |
| `GET` | `/admin/accounts/codex` | JSON: Codex store metadata (name, expiry, account ID — never the token) |
| `GET` | `/admin/observed` | JSON: read-only observed Claude, Codex, Gemini, Kimi, Grok, and Cursor identity, state, and provider-native usage — never token material |
| `GET` | `/admin/pool` | JSON: per-`claude_oauth`/`chatgpt_oauth` managed-pool state |
| `POST` | `/admin/accounts/claude` | `{name, mode}` → start Claude provisioning (`oauth` or `setup_token`); omitted `mode` defaults to `setup_token`; returns `{authorize_url}` |
| `POST` | `/admin/accounts/claude/{name}/complete` | `{code}` → finish; stores the Claude account |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/accounts/claude/{name}` | Remove the Claude account's store file |
| `POST` | `/admin/accounts/codex` | `{name}` → start ChatGPT OAuth; returns `{authorize_url}` |
| `POST` | `/admin/accounts/codex/{name}/complete` | `{code}` with a full callback URL or `<code>#<state>` → finish and store the Codex account |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/accounts/codex/{name}` | Remove the Codex account's store file |

Gateway-owned errors keep the Anthropic error shape (`ShuntError`); page routes
render minimal server-side HTML with inline CSS/JS and no external requests.

## Phase 1 — provisioning flow

The browser flow reuses the CLI OAuth/setup-token internals in
`auth/claude/login.rs` (`generate_pkce`, `build_authorize_url`,
`exchange_code`) and stores through `claude_store`. The upstream redirect URI is
fixed to `platform.claude.com/oauth/code/callback` for this remote/manual flow —
the CLI's full-OAuth mode can use a localhost callback, but that loopback would
return to the operator's browser host rather than a remote shunt server. The
operator therefore pastes `<code>#<state>` into the form for both web modes.

1. `POST /admin/accounts/claude {name, mode}` validates the name and mode,
   generates a PKCE verifier/challenge + `state`, stores a single-use pending
   login with its authoritative flow kind (TTL `pending_ttl_secs`), and returns
   the authorize URL (`https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize`). `mode =
   "oauth"` requests the full refreshable Claude scope; `mode = "setup_token"`
   requests `user:inference`. Omitting `mode` defaults to `setup_token` for API
   backward compatibility, while the dashboard explicitly sends `oauth` by
   default.
2. The operator opens the URL, signs in to the target Claude account, approves,
   and pastes the resulting `<code>#<state>`.
3. `POST /admin/accounts/claude/{name}/complete {code}` verifies `state`
   (constant-time), exchanges the code at the token endpoint (honoring
   `SHUNT_CLAUDE_TOKEN_URL` for tests), then dispatches by the server-stored
   pending kind. Setup-token mode requests the one-year expiry, requires an
   account UUID, and calls `store_setup_token`. Full OAuth omits that expiry
   override, requires a non-empty refresh token, accepts an optional account
   UUID, computes `expiresAt`, and calls `store_oauth_tokens`. Both writes are
   atomic at `0600`; the pending entry is consumed. The completion request
   cannot switch modes.
4. The completion response reports whether the account is **live immediately** (a
   `claude_oauth` provider with an empty `accounts` list scans the store each
   request) or needs a name-only `[[providers.<name>.accounts]]` entry + reload.

Removal deletes the store file directly, path-guarded so a caller-supplied name
can never escape the accounts directory. This is new writeback behavior over an
operator-owned store file (issue-sanctioned) and touches no upstream state.

### Codex/ChatGPT OAuth

The Codex form reuses the shared PKCE generator but follows the Codex CLI OAuth
contract from [`m2-chatgpt-oauth.md`](m2-chatgpt-oauth.md): authorize at
`https://auth.openai.com/oauth/authorize` with the fixed
`http://localhost:1455/auth/callback` redirect, then exchange the code using an
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. The operator may paste either the full
redirect URL from the browser address bar or `<code>#<state>`. Completion checks
the pending state in constant time, requires a refresh token, derives the account
ID from the access-token JWT, and writes the verbatim `auth.json` shape at `0600`.
`SHUNT_CODEX_TOKEN_URL` overrides the exchange endpoint for local tests; an
invalid or non-HTTPS/non-loopback override is ignored with a warning (mirroring the
Claude completion flow) instead of silently, and the exchange POST uses the
redirect-hardened client so a permitted endpoint cannot 3xx the single-use code to
an unsafe plaintext host. No access, refresh, or ID token is returned or logged.

Like Claude, an empty-account `chatgpt_oauth` provider scans the Codex store and
makes the new account live on its next request. Explicit-account providers need a
name-only account entry and reload.

## Phase 2 — observed usage and managed-pool health

The dashboard is usage-first. `GET /admin/observed` discovers supported local
credentials on each request but keeps every token/session in a private,
non-serializable model. Claude Code checks its configured/default credential file,
then macOS Keychain service `Claude Code-credentials`; Codex, Gemini, Kimi, and
Grok read their CLI credential stores; Cursor opens Cursor.app's `state.vscdb`
with `SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY`. The endpoint masks account identity, labels
ownership as `observed`, and never invokes a refresh/writeback store. Provider
requests have a 15-second timeout. Claude reads `/api/oauth/usage`, with the
token-free snapshot cached process-wide for 60 seconds. The Claude row is the
one exception to the identity masking above: it carries the account `uuid` so
the table can tell an observation and a managed pool account holding the same
subscription apart from two genuinely different accounts. The value is already
returned unmasked by `GET /admin/accounts` to the same authenticated caller, so
this adds no disclosure the admin surface did not already make. Gemini returns every
Code Assist model bucket, Kimi returns weekly and 5-hour windows, Grok returns
credit/product usage, and Cursor returns billing-cycle, Auto + Composer, and
named-model usage. Codex remains `response-derived`: both translated Messages
traffic and raw inbound Responses attach the default CLI account id to
`x-codex-*` quota capture without importing the credential into the managed
store. Before such traffic its row explicitly says it is waiting for traffic.

The usage table groups by provider: the provider is named once and its accounts
nest beneath it, folding managed pool accounts in alongside the read-only
observations rather than stranding them in the advanced section. An observation
and a managed account are coalesced into one row when their account `uuid`
matches — one subscription is one row, labelled with the managed account name,
with the observation's windows preferred because the pool only learns a window
from a response header it has actually received.

Coalescing is deliberately conservative: identity resolves to `None` whenever
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `CLAUDE_CREDENTIALS` is set, and an unidentified
observation never matches. Both Claude credential sources are profile-agnostic
(the fixed Keychain service name above; a hardcoded
`$HOME/.claude/.credentials.json`, unless `CLAUDE_CREDENTIALS` relocates it)
while `oauthAccount.accountUuid` is read from a config directory that
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` relocates, so with either variable set the recorded
identity can name a different account than the credential that was actually
read — observed against a live two-account pool, where it labelled an
exhausted account's usage with the other account's uuid. Declining to merge
costs a combined row; guessing costs a silently mis-attributed quota bar.
Closing that gap needs a token-scoped identity source, which does not exist
today: `/api/oauth/usage` is the only Claude endpoint read here, and
`shuntAccountUuid` is captured only at login/import time.

The known `uuid` is still attached even when the local token has expired: the
account id is read independently of token validity, so an expired observation
keeps matching its managed row (and inherits that row's "Needs login"
override) instead of rendering as an unrelated duplicate.

Managed provisioning and store metadata remain available under a collapsed
**Manage pool accounts (advanced)** section. `AccountPool::snapshot(provider, &[AccountConfig], model)` returns a token-free,
serializable view per account: 5h/7d/7d_oi utilization + reset, unified status,
cooldown-seconds-remaining, `near_quota`, and a derived `available` flag. It reads
the same `entries` map `select_order` reads, clears only already-past quota
buckets (as the next selection would), never mutates the round-robin cursor, and
never inserts entries for accounts the pool has not yet seen (reported as
`has_state: false`). `AccountPool` tracks no sticky flag or last-selected
timestamp, so the dashboard reports what is actually stored rather than inventing
it. `GET /admin/pool` enumerates each `claude_oauth` and `chatgpt_oauth`
provider's accounts (its configured list, or the corresponding Claude/Codex store
scan for an empty list — the same resolution the adapters use). Codex successful
responses now populate the 5h/7d fields from `x-codex-*` rate-limit headers;
unsupported windows are ignored and `7d_oi` remains `None` because Codex has no
analog. Since issue #195 this recorded state also feeds Codex account selection (see `m10-codex-multi-account.md`), in addition to the dashboard display.

## Shared foundations with gateway login

The gateway-login milestone (Claude Code `/login` against shunt) is inbound and
separate, but should reuse rather than duplicate:

- the browser/admin **session-auth layer** — the `/device` approval page needs an
  authenticated human, the same session mechanism as `/admin`;
- the server-rendered **page + CSRF** convention;
- the **`[server.admin]` opt-in** surface — the gateway-login block can nest
  beside it;
- the single-use, TTL-bound **pending store** — the device-flow "pending
  authorization" is the same shape (`session::PendingStore` is written generically
  for this reuse).

## Testing

- Unit: session/pending TTL + single-use + attempt cap, rate limiter, CSRF
  accept/reject, constant-time admin auth, cookie `Secure` loopback carve-out,
  `AccountPool::snapshot`, `claude_store::list_account_meta`/`remove_account`.
- Integration (`tests/admin_surface.rs`): the routes are absent without the block
  (404); API requires auth (401); setup-token mode keeps the legacy omitted-mode
  behavior and one-year exchange; full Claude OAuth requests the full scope,
  omits the expiry override, and persists a refreshable account; ChatGPT OAuth
  carries the Codex CLI authorize parameters, accepts both callback paste forms,
  uses a form-encoded exchange, persists verbatim auth.json, and appears in the
  pool; malformed or unknown modes and invalid account names fail without storing
  a file; missing refresh tokens fail closed; list/pool/response payloads never
  expose token material; cookie mutations without a CSRF token are rejected
  (403); fail-closed startup without the tokens env.
