title: Admin & Remote Provisioning
description: Enable shunt's admin web surface to provision Claude and Codex accounts remotely and inspect account-pool health.
---

shunt can expose an admin-authenticated web surface for provisioning upstream Claude and Codex/ChatGPT accounts and viewing the state of each `claude_oauth` and `chatgpt_oauth` account pool. It is opt-in: when `[server.admin]` is absent, none of the `/admin*` routes are registered and shunt's default HTTP surface is unchanged.

This builds on the [Anthropic multi-account](/guides/anthropic-multi-account/) and [Codex multi-account](/guides/codex-multi-account/) stores. The Claude form can create a refreshable full-OAuth account or a one-year, inference-only setup-token account. The Codex form creates a refreshable ChatGPT OAuth account. Importing existing credential files remains CLI-only.

## Enable the admin surface

Add the optional table and provide at least one admin credential through the configured environment variable:

```toml
[server.admin]                        # all keys optional; defaults shown
header = "x-shunt-admin-token"
tokens_env = "SHUNT_ADMIN_TOKENS"
session_ttl_secs = 3600
pending_ttl_secs = 600
```

```bash
export SHUNT_ADMIN_TOKENS="ops:$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
shunt check
shunt run
```

Credentials use the same comma-separated `name:token` format as `SHUNT_CLIENT_TOKENS`, but they are a separate security boundary. Do not reuse a `[server.auth]` client token as an admin token. Startup fails closed if `[server.admin]` is present but its token environment variable is unset, empty, or malformed.

### Add OIDC/SSO browser login

Keep the admin token configured, then add an optional OIDC provider for browser sign-in:

```toml
[server.admin.oidc]
public_url = "https://admin.example.com"
issuer = "https://accounts.example.com"
client_id = "shunt-admin"
client_secret_env = "SHUNT_ADMIN_OIDC_SECRET"
allowed_domains = ["example.com"]
# allowed_emails = ["operator@example.net"]
```

```bash
export SHUNT_ADMIN_OIDC_SECRET="<provider client secret>"
```

Register `https://admin.example.com/admin/oidc/callback` as the provider redirect URI. `public_url` must be the externally reachable bare HTTPS origin; plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback development. At least one allowed domain or full email is required, and shunt accepts only an OIDC UserInfo identity whose email is non-empty and verified.

The login page retains the admin-token form and adds **Sign in with SSO** (or **Sign in with Google** for Google's issuer). The start request is same-origin guarded, uses PKCE and a short-lived single-use state, and is rate-limited with token login. On callback, shunt exchanges the code without exposing it, fetches the verified identity, re-checks the current hot-reloaded allowlist, creates the ordinary HttpOnly admin session, and redirects only to `/admin`. Provider errors remain generic in the browser, and shunt never logs tokens, secrets, or authorization codes. For GitHub or SAML, put an OIDC broker such as Dex in front rather than configuring provider-specific OAuth2 directly.

See the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/#serveradmin-optional) for every key and default. The [endpoint reference](/reference/endpoints/) lists the browser and JSON routes.

## Provision a Claude account in the browser

1. Open `/admin` and sign in with an admin token.
2. Enter an account name containing only lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens.
3. Select **Full OAuth (refreshable)** (the dashboard default) or **Setup token (1-year, inference-only)**, then select **Start**.
4. Open the displayed authorize URL in another tab. Sign in to the target Claude account and approve access.
5. Copy the resulting `<code>#<state>` value back to the admin page and select **Complete**.
6. shunt stores the account. A provider with an empty `accounts` list picks it up on its next request without a restart. Otherwise, add a name-only entry and reload:

   ```toml
   [[providers.anthropic.accounts]]
   name = "backup"
   ```

A started flow remains valid for `pending_ttl_secs` (10 minutes by default), giving the operator time to open the authorization page and paste the result. The server records the selected mode with the pending attempt, so the completion request cannot switch token types. Full OAuth stores access and refresh tokens and appears as credential kind `imported`; setup-token mode stores a static credential with kind `setup_token`. The completion response reports whether the account was stored and whether the current provider configuration makes it live.

Account-store changes are discovered per request, so scan-mode providers do not need a restart after an account is added or removed.

## Provision a Codex account in the browser

1. In **Add Codex account**, enter a lowercase account name and select **Start Codex login**.
2. Open the authorize URL, sign in to the target ChatGPT account, and approve access.
3. OpenAI redirects the browser to `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`. The localhost page will normally fail to load; this is expected because the admin flow does not run a callback server in the operator's browser.
4. Copy the **full URL from the browser address bar**, paste it into the admin page, and select **Complete Codex login**. The JSON API also accepts `<code>#<state>`.
5. shunt exchanges the code, requires a refresh token and ChatGPT account ID, and writes a private Codex `auth.json`-shaped account file.

An empty-account `chatgpt_oauth` provider, including the built-in `codex` provider, discovers the new store account on its next request. An explicitly configured pool needs a name-only entry:

```toml
[[providers.codex.accounts]]
name = "codex-backup"
```

`SHUNT_CODEX_TOKEN_URL` overrides the ChatGPT token endpoint for local integration testing. shunt accepts HTTPS overrides or plain HTTP loopback URLs only; leave it unset in production.

## Inspect pool health

The dashboard shows account-store metadata and current state for each provider configured with `auth = "claude_oauth"` or `auth = "chatgpt_oauth"`. Claude rows include the 5-hour, shared 7-day, and `7d_oi` utilization observed from upstream responses, along with status and cooldown state. When upstream reported a reset time, each window cell also shows the time remaining until the window resets (e.g. `3d 4h`), with the absolute reset timestamp available on hover. Codex rows show the 5-hour and 7-day windows reported in `x-codex-*` response headers; unsupported windows are ignored and `7d_oi` stays `—` because Codex has no analog. Codex usage also feeds quota-aware account selection, exactly as Claude usage does (issue #195).

The Claude account list exposes account name, credential kind (`setup_token` or `imported`), expiry, and UUID. The Codex list exposes account name, access-token expiry, and ChatGPT account ID. Neither endpoint returns token material. See [Anthropic Multi-Account](/guides/anthropic-multi-account/#selection-and-proactive-rotation) and [Codex Multi-Account](/guides/codex-multi-account/) for the respective selection behavior.

For API/curl access to account metadata, pool state, provisioning, or account removal, send the admin token in the configured header (default `x-shunt-admin-token`) and use the JSON routes documented in [HTTP Endpoints](/reference/endpoints/). Header-authenticated requests do not use the browser session and are exempt from CSRF checks. Start Claude provisioning with `{ "name": "backup", "mode": "oauth" }` or `mode: "setup_token"`; omitting `mode` keeps the API's backward-compatible `setup_token` default. Start Codex provisioning with `{ "name": "codex-backup" }`, then complete it with `{ "code": "<full redirect URL or code#state>" }`.

## CLI and SSH fallback

Use the CLI when the shunt host is not reachable in a browser. Full OAuth normally opens a browser and completes through a temporary `127.0.0.1` callback; over SSH or in a headless environment, force the same manual-paste redirect used by the admin page:

```bash
shunt login claude --name backup --mode oauth --manual
```

To import the host's current refreshable Claude Code login instead:

```bash
shunt login claude --name primary --mode import
```

To create a one-year inference-only credential:

```bash
shunt login claude --name ci --mode setup-token
```

To import the host's current Codex login instead of using browser OAuth:

```bash
shunt login codex --name codex-backup
```

`--long-lived` remains a deprecated alias for `--mode setup-token`. The admin surface supports Claude full OAuth/setup-token provisioning and Codex ChatGPT OAuth. Existing-file imports require host access and therefore stay CLI-only.

:::caution[Refresh-token rotation]
A refreshable account must have one active owner. OAuth refresh may replace the refresh token and invalidate an older copy, so do not share one store file across processes or copy it to another independently running host. Provision each process separately, or choose setup-token mode where a static non-refreshable credential is appropriate.

## Security

- Put the admin surface behind HTTPS or a trusted tunnel such as WireGuard or Tailscale. shunt serves plain HTTP itself; use TLS termination in front when exposing it remotely.
- Generate a strong admin token and keep it separate from `[server.auth]` client credentials. Admin access can add and remove upstream accounts.
- Browser login creates an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict session cookie whether authentication used the admin token or OIDC. The cookie is Secure except on loopback hosts, so local HTTP development still works.
- Mutating browser requests require a per-session `x-csrf-token` and pass a same-origin check. API/curl calls authenticate with the admin header instead and do not carry ambient cookie authority.
- Provisioning completion is rate-limited. shunt never logs or returns token material, and account additions and removals are audit-logged by account name.

Without `[server.admin]`, the routes do not exist. This is stronger than leaving an unused dashboard unauthenticated: the admin surface is absent unless explicitly enabled.
