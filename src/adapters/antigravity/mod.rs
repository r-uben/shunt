//! Antigravity CLI adapter (`agy`).
//!
//! `agy` is not a text-completion endpoint — it is a full agent with its own
//! tool set (file edits, shell, search, browser) and its own loop. This adapter
//! therefore runs it in agentic print mode and translates its
//! `--output-format stream-json` events back into Anthropic Messages SSE, so a
//! Gemini-routed turn can actually do work rather than only describe it.
//!
//! Consequences worth knowing before routing traffic here:
//!
//! - Tools are `agy`'s, not the caller's. `tools` supplied on the Messages
//!   request are not forwarded, and no `tool_use` block is ever returned; the
//!   CLI resolves its own tool calls internally and returns finished work.
//! - It runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, because a print-mode run
//!   has no interactive channel to approve a permission prompt on. `--add-dir`
//!   is not a sandbox: the agent still has shell access and can act outside
//!   that directory. Treat this provider as arbitrary code execution as the
//!   user running shunt, and see [`resolve_workspace`] for the trust boundary
//!   on where it starts. Each run is isolated in its own process group so every
//!   cancellation path also kills tool subprocesses spawned by `agy`.
